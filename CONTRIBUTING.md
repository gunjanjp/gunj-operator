## Development Process

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

See our [Developer Getting Started Guide](docs/development/getting-started.md) for detailed instructions.

### Code Style

#### Go Code Style

We follow the standard Go formatting guidelines:

```go
// Good
func (r *Reconciler) ReconcilePlatform(ctx context.Context, platform *v1beta1.ObservabilityPlatform) error {
    log := ctrl.LoggerFrom(ctx)
    
    if platform == nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("platform cannot be nil")
    }
    
    // Implementation
    return nil
}
```

See [Go Coding Standards](docs/development/coding-standards-go.md) for more details.

#### TypeScript/React Code Style

We use ESLint and Prettier for TypeScript/React code:

```typescript
// Good
export const PlatformCard: React.FC<PlatformCardProps> = ({ platform, onSelect }) => {
  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    onSelect?.(platform);
  }, [platform, onSelect]);

  return (
    <Card onClick={handleClick}>
      <CardContent>{platform.name}</CardContent>
    </Card>
  );
};
```

See [TypeScript/React Coding Standards](docs/development/coding-standards-typescript.md) for more details.

### Commit Messages

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

#### Types

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that don't affect code meaning
- **refactor**: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: Code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **build**: Changes that affect the build system
- **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
- **chore**: Other changes that don't modify src or test files

#### Examples

```
feat(operator): add support for Tempo tracing

- Implement Tempo component manager
- Add Tempo CRD fields
- Create Tempo deployment logic
- Add integration tests

Closes #123
```

```
fix(ui): correct platform status color

The platform status indicator was showing green for failed
platforms. This fixes the color mapping to correctly show
red for failed status.

Fixes #456
```

### Testing

All code changes must include appropriate tests:

#### Go Testing

```go
func TestReconcilePlatform(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name      string
        platform  *v1beta1.ObservabilityPlatform
        wantErr   bool
        wantPhase string
    }{
        {
            name: "successful reconciliation",
            platform: &v1beta1.ObservabilityPlatform{
                ObjectMeta: metav1.ObjectMeta{
                    Name: "test-platform",
                },
            },
            wantErr:   false,
            wantPhase: "Ready",
        },
    }
    
    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            // Test implementation
        })
    }
}
```

#### React Testing

```typescript
describe('PlatformCard', () => {
  it('should render platform name', () => {
    const platform = { name: 'test-platform' };
    render(<PlatformCard platform={platform} />);
    
    expect(screen.getByText('test-platform')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```
