## 2. Security Principles

### 2.1 Security by Design
Security must be considered at every stage of development:
- Threat modeling during design
- Secure coding practices
- Security testing before release
- Regular security assessments

### 2.2 Least Privilege
All components operate with minimal required permissions:
- RBAC with minimal roles

### 2.3 Defense in Depth
Multiple layers of security controls:
- Container security
- Network policies
- Authentication & authorization
- Encryption in transit and at rest
- Monitoring and alerting

### 2.4 Zero Trust
Never trust, always verify:
- Authenticate all connections
- Authorize all actions
- Encrypt all communications
- Monitor all activities

## 4. Security Requirements

### 4.1 Code Security

#### Secure Coding Standards
```go
// CORRECT: Parameterized queries
query := "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?"
rows, err := db.Query(query, userID)

// INCORRECT: String concatenation
// query := fmt.Sprintf("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s", userID)
```

#### Input Validation
- Validate all external inputs
- Use allow-lists over deny-lists
- Sanitize data before processing
- Implement proper error handling

#### Authentication Requirements
- Strong password policies
- Multi-factor authentication support
- Session management
- Token expiration and rotation

### 4.2 Container Security

#### Image Requirements
- Use minimal base images (distroless/alpine)
- Run as non-root user
- No unnecessary packages
- Regular vulnerability scanning

#### Runtime Security
```yaml
securityContext:
  runAsNonRoot: true
  runAsUser: 65532
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
  capabilities:
    drop:
    - ALL
```

### 4.3 Infrastructure Security

#### Network Policies
- Default deny all traffic
- Explicit allow rules only
- Segmentation between components
- Encrypted communications (TLS 1.2+)

#### Secret Management
- No hardcoded secrets
- Use Kubernetes secrets or external vaults
- Regular rotation
- Audit access logs

### 4.4 Supply Chain Security

#### Dependency Management
- Regular dependency updates
- Vulnerability scanning
- License compliance
- Signed artifacts

#### Build Pipeline
- Protected branches
- Code review requirements
- Automated security scanning
- Signed commits
