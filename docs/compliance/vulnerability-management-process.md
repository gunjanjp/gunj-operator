## üìã Overview

This document defines the vulnerability management process for the Gunj Operator project. It establishes procedures for identifying, assessing, prioritizing, remediating, and tracking security vulnerabilities throughout the project lifecycle.

## üéØ Objectives

1. **Minimize Security Risk**: Reduce exposure to known vulnerabilities
2. **Rapid Response**: Quick identification and remediation of vulnerabilities
3. **Compliance**: Meet security standards and regulations
4. **Transparency**: Clear communication with stakeholders
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Learn from vulnerabilities to prevent recurrence

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Vulnerability Discovery

### Discovery Methods

| Method | Frequency | Tool/Process | Owner |
|--------|-----------|--------------|-------|
| **Automated Scanning** |
| Code scanning (SAST) | Every commit | Semgrep, SonarQube | CI/CD Pipeline |
| Dependency scanning | Daily | Snyk, Dependabot | Security Bot |
| Container scanning | Every build | Trivy, Grype | Build Pipeline |
| Infrastructure scanning | Weekly | Cloud provider tools | DevOps Team |

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Vulnerability Assessment

### Severity Classification

| Severity | CVSS Score | Description | Example |
|----------|------------|-------------|---------|
| **Critical** | 9.0-10.0 | Immediate threat, easily exploitable | RCE, authentication bypass |
| **High** | 7.0-8.9 | Significant impact, exploitable | Privilege escalation, data exposure |
| **Medium** | 4.0-6.9 | Moderate impact, harder to exploit | XSS, information disclosure |
| **Low** | 0.1-3.9 | Limited impact, difficult to exploit | Minor info leak, DoS |

### Assessment Criteria

```yaml
assessment_factors:
  technical:
    - cvss_base_score
    - exploit_complexity
    - attack_vector
    - privileges_required
    - user_interaction
  
  environmental:
    - affected_components
    - data_sensitivity
    - system_criticality
    - network_exposure
    - compensating_controls
  
  threat:
    - exploit_availability
    - threat_actor_interest
    - public_disclosure
    - active_exploitation
```

### Risk Scoring Formula

```javascript
function calculateRiskScore(vulnerability) {
  const baseScore = vulnerability.cvss.score;
  const exploitability = vulnerability.exploitability * 0.3;
  const impact = vulnerability.businessImpact * 0.4;
  const exposure = vulnerability.exposureLevel * 0.3;
  
  return (baseScore * 0.4) + exploitability + impact + exposure;
}
```
