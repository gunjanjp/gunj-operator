## Project Description

### What is Gunj Operator?

Gunj Operator is a Kubernetes-native operator that simplifies the deployment, management, and operation of complete observability platforms in cloud-native environments. It provides a declarative approach to managing Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, and Tempo as a unified observability solution.

### Problem Statement

Organizations adopting Kubernetes face significant challenges in implementing comprehensive observability:
- Complex manual configuration of multiple observability tools
- Lack of standardization across environments
- Difficulty in maintaining consistency at scale
- Time-consuming upgrades and migrations
- Resource optimization challenges

### Solution

Gunj Operator solves these challenges by:
- Providing a single CRD to define entire observability platforms
- Automating component deployment and configuration
- Ensuring consistency across environments
- Facilitating zero-downtime upgrades
- Optimizing resource usage automatically

## Statement on Alignment with CNCF

### Cloud Native Principles

Gunj Operator embodies cloud native principles:
- **Containerized**: All components run in containers
- **Dynamically Orchestrated**: Kubernetes-native operator pattern
- **Microservices Oriented**: Modular component architecture
- **Declarative Configuration**: CRD-based platform definition
- **Scalable**: Horizontal and vertical scaling support

### CNCF Ecosystem Integration

The project integrates with multiple CNCF projects:
- **Prometheus**: Core metrics collection
- **Fluentd**: Log forwarding support
- **OpenTelemetry**: Tracing and metrics
- **Helm**: Package management
- **gRPC**: Internal communication
