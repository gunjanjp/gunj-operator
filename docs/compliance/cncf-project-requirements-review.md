## üìã Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive review of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) project requirements and establishes a roadmap for the Gunj Operator to achieve CNCF graduation through the three maturity levels: Sandbox, Incubating, and Graduated.

## üéØ CNCF Maturity Model Overview

The CNCF uses a three-stage maturity model for projects:

### 1. **Sandbox** (Entry Level)
- For early-stage projects
- Experimental and innovative
- Community building phase

### 2. **Incubating** (Growth Stage)
- Production usage emerging
- Growing adoption
- Healthy community

### 3. **Graduated** (Mature)
- Production-ready
- Wide adoption
- Thriving ecosystem

## üîç Gap Analysis

### Critical Gaps for Sandbox

1. **Community Building**
   - Need: Multiple contributors from different organizations
   - Action: Outreach program, contribution workshops

2. **Documentation**
   - Need: Complete documentation set
   - Action: Documentation sprint, user guides

3. **Governance**
   - Need: Clear project governance
   - Action: Create governance model, decision process

### Path to Incubating

1. **Production Adoption**
   - Strategy: Beta program with early adopters
   - Timeline: 6-12 months post-Sandbox

2. **Release Process**
   - Strategy: Semantic versioning, regular releases
   - Timeline: Start immediately

3. **Security**
   - Strategy: Security policy, vulnerability process
   - Timeline: Before Sandbox application

### Path to Graduated

1. **Enterprise Features**
   - Multi-tenancy
   - High availability
   - Disaster recovery

2. **Ecosystem**
   - Service mesh integration
   - Policy engines
   - Cost management
