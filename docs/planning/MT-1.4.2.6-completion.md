# Micro-task Completion Summary

**Phase**: 1.4.2 - CNCF Compliance Planning  
**Micro-task**: MT-1.4.2.6 - Define performance benchmarks  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Date**: June 12, 2025  

## 📋 What Was Accomplished

1. **Created Performance Benchmarks Document** (`performance-benchmarks.md`)
   - Comprehensive performance targets for all components
   - Operator reconciliation: <100ms latency, 100/sec throughput
   - API performance: <50ms p95 for GET, 10K RPS capability
   - UI performance: <1.5s LCP, 60fps runtime
   - Scalability targets: Support 1000+ platforms
   - End-to-end operation benchmarks
   - SLO definitions: 99.9% availability

2. **Created Performance Testing Framework** (`performance-testing-framework.md`)
   - Go benchmark tests for operator
   - k6 load tests for API
   - Lighthouse tests for UI
   - Memory leak detection
   - Database query optimization
   - CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions
   - Monitoring setup with Prometheus/Grafana

## 🎯 Key Performance Targets Established

### Operator Performance
- **Reconciliation**: <100ms (p95), <2s duration
- **Resource Usage**: <500m CPU, <256MB memory (active)
- **Scale**: 1000 platforms with <1s response time

### API Performance  
- **REST API**: <50ms (p95) for GET operations
- **GraphQL**: <30ms for simple queries
- **Throughput**: 10K RPS for read operations

### UI Performance
- **Core Web Vitals**: LCP <1.5s, FID <50ms, CLS <0.05
- **Bundle Size**: <500KB gzipped
- **Runtime**: 60fps on desktop, 30fps on mobile
