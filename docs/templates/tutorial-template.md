## What You'll Learn

By the end of this tutorial, you will:

- ‚úÖ [Learning outcome 1]
- ‚úÖ [Learning outcome 2]
- ‚úÖ [Learning outcome 3]
- ‚úÖ [Learning outcome 4]

## Before You Begin

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have:

1. **Kubernetes cluster** (v1.26+)
   ```bash
   kubectl version --short
   ```

2. **Gunj Operator installed** (v2.0+)
   ```bash
   kubectl get deployment -n gunj-system gunj-operator
   ```

3. **Required permissions**
   ```bash
   kubectl auth can-i create observabilityplatforms
   ```

### What We're Building

    A[User] --> B[Platform]

    B --> D[Grafana]
    B --> E[Loki]
```

## Step 1: [First Major Step]

Let's start by [describing what we're doing in this step].

### 1.1 [Substep Title]

First, we need to [action]:

```bash
# Command with explanation
kubectl create namespace tutorial-demo
```

Expected output:
```
namespace/tutorial-demo created
```

> üí° **Tip**: [Helpful tip or best practice]

### 1.2 [Substep Title]

Next, create a configuration file:

```yaml
# platform-config.yaml
apiVersion: observability.io/v1beta1
kind: ObservabilityPlatform
metadata:
  name: tutorial-platform
  namespace: tutorial-demo
spec:
  # We'll add configuration here
  components:
    prometheus:
      enabled: true
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: [Important note or warning]

Apply the configuration:

```bash
kubectl apply -f platform-config.yaml
```

### üìù Check Your Progress

At this point, you should have:
- [ ] Created the namespace
- [ ] Created the configuration file
- [ ] Applied the configuration

Run this command to verify:
```bash
kubectl get observabilityplatform -n tutorial-demo
```

## Step 2: [Second Major Step]

Now that we have [what was accomplished in step 1], let's [what we're doing in step 2].

### 2.1 [Substep Title]

[Explanation of what we're doing]

```yaml
# Update platform-config.yaml
apiVersion: observability.io/v1beta1
kind: ObservabilityPlatform
metadata:
  name: tutorial-platform
  namespace: tutorial-demo
spec:
  components:
    prometheus:
      enabled: true
      version: v2.48.0  # Added version
      resources:        # Added resources
        requests:
          memory: "1Gi"
          cpu: "500m"
```

### 2.2 [Substep Title]

Apply the updated configuration:

```bash
kubectl apply -f platform-config.yaml
```

Watch the platform status:

```bash
kubectl get observabilityplatform tutorial-platform -n tutorial-demo -w
```

You should see the status change:
```
NAME                STATUS      AGE
tutorial-platform   Creating    5s
tutorial-platform   Ready       45s
```

### üîç Understanding What Happened

When you applied the configuration:

1. The operator detected the change
2. It created/updated the Prometheus deployment
3. It configured the resources as specified
4. It updated the platform status

## Step 3: [Third Major Step]

Let's explore what was created.

### 3.1 View Resources

List all resources created by the operator:

```bash
kubectl get all -n tutorial-demo -l app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=gunj-operator
```

Output will show:
```
NAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/prometheus-tutorial-platform-0      2/2     Running   0          2m

NAME                               TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      PORT(S)    AGE
service/prometheus-tutorial        ClusterIP   10.96.10.10     9090/TCP   2m

NAME                                           READY   AGE
statefulset.apps/prometheus-tutorial-platform  1/1     2m
```

### 3.2 Access the Service

Port-forward to access Prometheus:

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n tutorial-demo svc/prometheus-tutorial 9090:9090
```

Open your browser to [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090)

> üéâ **Success!** You should see the Prometheus UI.

## Step 4: [Additional Steps as Needed]

[Continue with more steps following the same pattern]

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Platform Stuck in Creating State

**Symptoms**:
- Platform status shows "Creating" for more than 5 minutes

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check operator logs
kubectl logs -n gunj-system deployment/gunj-operator --tail=50

# Check events
kubectl get events -n tutorial-demo --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'
```

### Problem: Cannot Access Service

**Symptoms**:
- Port-forward command fails

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check if pod is running
kubectl get pods -n tutorial-demo

# Check service endpoints
kubectl get endpoints -n tutorial-demo
```

## Clean Up

To remove everything created in this tutorial:

```bash
# Delete the platform
kubectl delete observabilityplatform tutorial-platform -n tutorial-demo

# Delete the namespace
kubectl delete namespace tutorial-demo
```
