## Overview

Code reviews are a critical part of our development process. They help:
- Maintain code quality and consistency
- Share knowledge across the team
- Catch bugs before they reach production
- Improve overall system design
- Ensure compliance with project standards

### Review Responsibilities

**Authors:**
- Provide clear PR descriptions
- Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized
- Respond to feedback promptly
- Update PR based on review comments
- Ensure all checks pass

**Reviewers:**
- Review promptly (within 2 business days)
- Provide constructive feedback
- Check for compliance with standards

### 2. Review Stages

#### Stage 1: High-Level Review (5-10 minutes)
- Understand the overall purpose
- Check if the approach makes sense
- Identify any architectural concerns
- Verify PR scope is appropriate

#### Stage 2: Detailed Code Review (20-45 minutes)

## Review Comments

### Comment Guidelines

#### DO:
- Be constructive and professional
- Explain the "why" behind suggestions
- Provide examples or links
- Acknowledge good code
- Use "we" instead of "you"
- Ask questions to understand

#### DON'T:
- Be dismissive or rude
- Nitpick unnecessarily
- Block on preferences
- Assume malice
- Make it personal
- Ignore the context

### Comment Types

#### üî¥ **Blocking** (Must Fix)
Issues that must be resolved before merge:
```
üî¥ This will cause a nil pointer panic when the platform is not found.
Please add a nil check before accessing platform.Spec.
```

#### üü° **Important** (Should Fix)
Issues that should be addressed but aren't blocking:
```
üü° Consider extracting this logic into a separate function for better testability.
This would also make the reconciliation loop more readable.
```

#### üü¢ **Suggestion** (Nice to Have)
Optional improvements or preferences:
```
üü¢ nit: This could be simplified using the strings.Contains function.
```

#### ‚ùì **Question** (Clarification)
Questions to understand the code better:
```
‚ùì I'm not familiar with this pattern. Could you explain why we need
to check the cache here instead of querying the API directly?
```

#### üëç **Praise** (Good Code)
Acknowledge good practices:
```
üëç Great error handling! This makes debugging much easier.
```

### Example Review Comments

#### Constructive Feedback
```markdown
I see what you're trying to accomplish here, but I'm concerned about the performance
impact of calling the API in a loop. 

What if we batch these requests instead? Something like:

```go
func (r *Reconciler) updateStatuses(ctx context.Context, platforms []Platform) error {
    batch := make([]StatusUpdate, 0, len(platforms))
    for _, p := range platforms {
        batch = append(batch, StatusUpdate{
            Name: p.Name,
            Status: p.Status,
        })
    }
    return r.client.BatchUpdateStatus(ctx, batch)
}
```

This would reduce the number of API calls from N to 1.
```

#### Security Concern
```markdown
üî¥ Security Issue: This endpoint allows unauthenticated access to sensitive data.

Please add authentication middleware:

```go
router.GET("/api/v1/platforms/:id", 
    authMiddleware.RequireAuth(),
    authMiddleware.RequirePermission("platforms:read"),
    handler.GetPlatform,
)
```

Also, ensure we're not exposing internal fields in the response.
```

   - Communicate delays

2. **Be Thorough**
   - Review all changed files
   - Consider the bigger picture
   - Test locally if unsure
   - Check for common issues

3. **Be Constructive**
   - Focus on the code, not the person
   - Explain your reasoning
