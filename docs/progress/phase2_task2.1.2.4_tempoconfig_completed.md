# Gunj Operator - Phase 2: Operator Core Development
## Sub-Phase 2.1: CRD Development - Task 2.1.2: Component CRDs
### Micro-task 2.1.2.4: Create TempoConfig CRD - COMPLETED ✅

**Completion Date**: June 12, 2025
**Status**: Successfully Completed

### What Was Implemented:

1. **TempoConfig CRD Types** (`api/v1beta1/tempoconfig_types.go`):
   - Comprehensive Tempo-specific configuration management
   - Complete storage backend support (S3, GCS, Azure, Filesystem, Swift)
   - Distributor configuration with receivers and forwarding
   - Ingester settings with WAL and lifecycle management
   - Compactor configuration for block management
   - Querier and Query Frontend settings
   - Full receiver support (OTLP, Jaeger, Zipkin, OpenCensus, Kafka)
   - Metrics generator with service graphs and span metrics
   - Multi-tenancy configuration
   - Authentication support (Basic, OAuth2, OIDC)
   - Rate limiting configuration
   - Per-tenant overrides
   - Comprehensive caching support (Memcached, Redis, In-memory)

2. **Key Features Implemented**:
   - **Storage Configuration**:
     - Multi-backend support with specific configs
     - Connection pooling and optimization
     - WAL configuration for reliability
     - Caching layer configuration
   
   - **Trace Receivers**:
     - OTLP (gRPC and HTTP) with full configuration
     - Jaeger with all protocol support
     - Zipkin receiver
     - OpenCensus receiver
     - Kafka receiver with SASL auth
   
   - **Component Configuration**:
     - Distributor with forwarding and search
     - Ingester with lifecycle management
     - Compactor with retention policies
     - Querier with frontend integration
     - Query Frontend with search optimization
   
   - **Advanced Features**:
     - Metrics generation from traces
     - Service graph generation
     - Span metrics with filtering
     - Search capabilities
     - Multi-tenancy with per-tenant limits
     - Authentication and authorization
     - Rate limiting per tenant

3. **Example Configuration** (`config/samples/observability_v1beta1_tempoconfig.yaml`):
   - Production example with S3 storage
   - Development example with filesystem storage
   - GCS storage example
   - Azure storage example
   - Comprehensive configuration showcase

4. **CRD Registration**:
   - Added init() function in tempoconfig_types.go
   - Registered TempoConfig and TempoConfigList types
   - Ready for code generation

### Technical Decisions:

1. **Storage Flexibility**: Support for all major cloud providers and filesystem
2. **Receiver Support**: All major trace formats supported
3. **Multi-tenancy**: Built-in support with per-tenant configuration
4. **Metrics Generation**: Ability to derive metrics from trace data
5. **Authentication**: Support for modern auth methods (OIDC, OAuth2)
6. **Caching**: Multiple cache backends for performance
7. **Search**: Advanced search capabilities with indexing

### Files Created/Modified:
- ✅ Created: `api/v1beta1/tempoconfig_types.go`
- ✅ Created: `config/samples/observability_v1beta1_tempoconfig.yaml`

### Next Steps:
All Component CRDs (PrometheusConfig, GrafanaConfig, LokiConfig, TempoConfig) have been successfully created. Ready to proceed to:
- Micro-task 2.1.2.5: Create AlertingRule CRD
- Or move to the next sub-phase based on the plan

### Integration Points:
- Integrates with ObservabilityPlatform CRD via targetPlatform reference
- Can reference secrets for credentials
- Compatible with other component configs for unified observability
- Ready for controller implementation
