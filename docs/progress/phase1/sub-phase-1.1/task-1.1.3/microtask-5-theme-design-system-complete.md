# Gunj Operator - Theme & Design System Planning Summary

**Phase**: 1 - Foundation & Architecture Design  
**Sub-Phase**: 1.1 - Architecture Planning  
**Task**: 1.1.3 - UI Architecture Design  
**Micro-task**: Plan theme and design system âœ“  
**Date**: June 12, 2025  

## Summary

Successfully completed the theme and design system planning for the Gunj Operator UI with the following deliverables:

### 1. Design System Documentation
- Created comprehensive design system document at `/docs/design/theme-design-system.md`
- Covers all aspects: colors, typography, spacing, components, animations, accessibility

### 2. Technology Choice
- **Selected**: Material-UI (MUI) v5 with heavy customization
- **Rationale**: 
  - Enterprise-ready components
  - Excellent TypeScript support
  - Strong accessibility features
  - Robust theming system
  - Large ecosystem

### 3. Theme Implementation
- Created theme configuration at `/ui/src/theme/theme.ts`
- Implemented light and dark theme palettes
- Defined semantic colors for platform states
- Created custom component overrides

### 4. Theme Provider
- Built React context-based theme provider at `/ui/src/theme/ThemeProvider.tsx`
- Supports light/dark/system modes
- Persists user preference in localStorage
- Responds to system theme changes

### 5. Status Variants System
- Created helper utilities at `/ui/src/theme/statusVariants.ts`
- Platform status colors and animations
- Component status mapping
- Health score calculations

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Color Palette**:
   - Primary: Kubernetes-inspired blue (#1976D2)
   - Semantic colors for platform states (healthy, degraded, critical)
   - Separate palettes for light and dark modes

2. **Typography**:
   - Primary font: Inter (modern, readable)
   - Code font: JetBrains Mono
   - Consistent scale from 10px to 48px

3. **Spacing System**:
   - Base unit: 8px
   - Consistent scale for predictable layouts

4. **Accessibility**:
   - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance target
   - Proper color contrast ratios
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - Screen reader compatibility

5. **Animation Standards**:
   - Standard transitions: 200-300ms
   - Subtle animations for real-time updates
   - Status-specific animations (pulse, shake)

## Next Steps

The theme and design system is now ready for implementation. The next micro-task in the UI Architecture Design is:
- **Create wireframes and mockups**

This will involve:
1. Creating low-fidelity wireframes for main screens
2. Developing high-fidelity mockups using the design system
3. Designing responsive layouts
4. Creating interactive prototypes
5. Documenting UI patterns and components

## Files Created
1. `/docs/design/theme-design-system.md` - Comprehensive design system documentation
2. `/ui/src/theme/theme.ts` - Theme configuration and palettes
3. `/ui/src/theme/ThemeProvider.tsx` - React theme provider component
4. `/ui/src/theme/statusVariants.ts` - Status color and animation helpers
5. `/ui/src/theme/index.ts` - Module exports
